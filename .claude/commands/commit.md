# Commit Command

Use the `commit` skill to create git commits with proper commit messages.

## Instructions

Execute the `commit` skill:

```
Use the Skill tool to run the "commit" skill
```

The commit skill will:
1. Check for staged changes
2. Analyze changes and detect commit style
3. Build appropriate commit message
4. Get user approval
5. Create the commit

**Note**: This command delegates all logic to the modular `commit` skill.
